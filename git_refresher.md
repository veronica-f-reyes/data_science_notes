# Git Refresher

## Our Everyday Workflow
1. Do work (add new files, edit exiting files, remove files) in a repo
- git status
2. `Git add filename.py` or `git add .` to add/stage the entire folder of changes
- git status
3. `git commit -m "Add filename.py exercises"` to make a commit
- git status
4. `git push`
- git status

## If we need to restore a repo from GitHub or copy someone's repo from GitHub
1. Navigate to that repo's address in GitHub
2. Click on the green "Code" button
3. Copy the clone address (will be https or ssh)
4. Navigate to the folder we want to be the parent folder
5. Git clone <paste in that git clone address>
6. This makes a new folder/repo on your machine w/ the same name as the github repo.

# How to get changes from an upstream repo 
- this could happen in group work
- this could happen if you edit content in the browser on GitHub
- `git pull`

## Heads Up
- `git push` is an upload (uploads the latest commits)
- `git pull` is an download (downloads the latest commits)
- If you *know* you want to go back to the last repo commit locally, `git checkout -f`
- If you need to go back to the last commit of a single file, `git checkout filename.py`

## Best Practices
- Commit early
- Commit often
- Commit and push @ the end of an exercise
- Commit and push once we finish a feature or a part of the DS pipeline
